 Ceph Internals
================

.. note:: If you're looking for how to use Ceph as a library from your
   own software, please see :doc:`/api/index`.

You can start a development mode Ceph cluster, after compiling the source, with::

	cd src
	install -d -m0755 out dev/osd0
	./vstart.sh -n -x -l
	# check that it's there
	./ceph health

.. todo:: vstart is woefully undocumented and full of sharp sticks to poke yourself with.
