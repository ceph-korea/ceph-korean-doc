===========================
Install Ceph Object Gateway
===========================

As of `firefly` (v0.80), Ceph Object Gateway is running on Civetweb (embedded
into the ``ceph-radosgw`` daemon) instead of Apache and FastCGI. Using Civetweb
simplifies the Ceph Object Gateway installation and configuration.

.. note:: To run the Ceph Object Gateway service, you should have a running
          Ceph storage cluster, and the gateway host should have access to the 
          public network.

.. note:: In version 0.80, the Ceph Object Gateway does not support SSL. You
          may setup a reverse proxy server with SSL to dispatch HTTPS requests 
          as HTTP requests to CivetWeb.

Execute the Pre-Installation Procedure
--------------------------------------

See Preflight_ and execute the pre-installation procedures on your Ceph Object
Gateway node. Specifically, you should disable ``requiretty`` on your Ceph
Deploy user, set SELinux to ``Permissive`` and set up a Ceph Deploy user with
password-less ``sudo``. For Ceph Object Gateways, you will need to open the
port that Civetweb will use in production.

.. note:: Civetweb runs on port ``7480`` by default.

Install Ceph Object Gateway
---------------------------

From the working directory of your administration server, install the Ceph
Object Gateway package on the Ceph Object Gateway node. For example::

 ceph-deploy install --rgw <gateway-node1> [<gateway-node2> ...]

The ``ceph-common`` package is a dependency, so ``ceph-deploy`` will install
this too. The ``ceph`` CLI tools are intended for administrators. To make your
Ceph Object Gateway node an administrator node, execute the following from the
working directory of your administration server::

 ceph-deploy admin <node-name>

Create a Gateway Instance
-------------------------

From the working directory of your administration server, create an instance of
the Ceph Object Gateway on the Ceph Object Gateway. For example::

 ceph-deploy rgw create <gateway-node1>

Once the gateway is running, you should be able to access it on port ``7480``
with an unauthenticated request like this::

 http://client-node:7480

If the gateway instance is working properly, you should receive a response like
this::

 <?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>
 <ListAllMyBucketsResult xmlns="http://s3.amazonaws.com/doc/2006-03-01/">
        <Owner>
 		<ID>anonymous</ID>
 		<DisplayName></DisplayName>
 	</Owner>
 	<Buckets>
 	</Buckets>
 </ListAllMyBucketsResult>

If at any point you run into trouble and you want to start over, execute the
following to purge the configuration::

 ceph-deploy purge <gateway-node1> [<gateway-node2>]
 ceph-deploy purgedata <gateway-node1> [<gateway-node2>]

If you execute ``purge``, you must re-install Ceph.

Change the Default Port
-----------------------

Civetweb runs on port ``7480`` by default. To change the default port (e.g., to
port ``80``), modify your Ceph configuration file in the working directory of
your administration server. Add a section entitled
``[client.rgw.<gateway-node>]``, replacing ``<gateway-node>`` with the short
node name of your Ceph Object Gateway node (i.e., ``hostname -s``).

.. note:: As of version 11.0.1, the Ceph Object Gateway **does** support SSL.
	See `Using SSL with Civetweb`_ for information on how to set that up.

For example, if your node name is ``gateway-node1``, add a section like this
after the ``[global]`` section::

 [client.rgw.gateway-node1]
 rgw_frontends = "civetweb port=80"

.. note:: Ensure that you leave no whitespace between ``port=<port-number>`` in
          the ``rgw_frontends`` key/value pair. The ``[client.rgw.gateway-node1]``
          heading identifies this portion of the Ceph configuration file as 
          configuring a Ceph Storage Cluster client where the client type is a Ceph
          Object Gateway (i.e., ``rgw``), and the name of the instance is
          ``gateway-node1``.

Push the updated configuration file to your Ceph Object Gateway node
(and other Ceph nodes)::

 ceph-deploy --overwrite-conf config push <gateway-node> [<other-nodes>]

To make the new port setting take effect, restart the Ceph Object
Gateway::

 sudo systemctl restart ceph-radosgw.service

Finally, check to ensure that the port you selected is open on the node's
firewall (e.g., port ``80``). If it is not open, add the port and reload the
firewall configuration. If you use the ``firewalld`` daemon, execute::

  sudo firewall-cmd --list-all
  sudo firewall-cmd --zone=public --add-port 80/tcp --permanent
  sudo firewall-cmd --reload

If you use ``iptables``, execute::

  sudo iptables --list
  sudo iptables -I INPUT 1 -i <iface> -p tcp -s <ip-address>/<netmask> --dport 80 -j ACCEPT

Replace ``<iface>`` and ``<ip-address>/<netmask>`` with the relevant values for
your Ceph Object Gateway node.

Once you have finished configuring ``iptables``, ensure that you make the
change persistent so that it will be in effect when your Ceph Object Gateway
node reboots. Execute::

  sudo apt-get install iptables-persistent

A terminal UI will open up. Select ``yes`` for the prompts to save current
``IPv4`` iptables rules to ``/etc/iptables/rules.v4`` and current ``IPv6``
iptables rules to ``/etc/iptables/rules.v6``.

The ``IPv4`` iptables rule that you set in the earlier step will be loaded in
``/etc/iptables/rules.v4`` and will be persistent across reboots.

If you add a new ``IPv4`` iptables rule after installing
``iptables-persistent`` you will have to add it to the rule file. In such case,
execute the following as the ``root`` user::

 iptables-save > /etc/iptables/rules.v4

Using SSL with Civetweb
-----------------------
.. _Using SSL with Civetweb:

Before using SSL with civetweb, you will need a certificate that will match
the host name that that will be used to access the Ceph Object Gateway.
You may wish to obtain one that has `subject alternate name` fields for
more flexibility.  If you intend to use S3-style subdomains
(`Add Wildcard to DNS`_), you will need a `wildcard` certificate.

Civetweb requires that the server key, server certificate, and any other
CA or intermediate certificates be supplied in one file.  Each of these
items must be in `pem` form.  Because the combined file contains the
secret key, it should be protected from unauthorized access.

To configure ssl operation, append ``s`` to the port number. For eg::

 [client.rgw.gateway-node1]
 rgw_frontends = civetweb port=443s ssl_certificate=/etc/ceph/private/keyandcert.pem

.. versionadded :: Luminous

Furthermore, civetweb can be made to bind to multiple ports, by separating them
with ``+`` in the configuration. This allows for use cases where both ssl and
non-ssl connections are hosted by a single rgw instance. For eg::

 [client.rgw.gateway-node1]
 rgw_frontends = civetweb port=80+443s ssl_certificate=/etc/ceph/private/keyandcert.pem

Additional Civetweb Configuration Options 
----------------------------------------- 
Some additional configuration options can be adjusted for the embedded Civetweb web server 
in the **Ceph Object Gateway** section of the ``ceph.conf`` file. 
A list of supported options, including an example, can be found in the `HTTP Frontends`_. 

Migrating from Apache to Civetweb
---------------------------------

If you are running the Ceph Object Gateway on Apache and FastCGI with Ceph
Storage v0.80 or above, you are already running Civetweb--it starts with the
``ceph-radosgw`` daemon and it's running on port 7480 by default so that it
doesn't conflict with your Apache and FastCGI installation and other commonly
used web service ports. Migrating to use Civetweb basically involves removing
your Apache installation. Then, you must remove Apache and FastCGI settings
from your Ceph configuration file and reset ``rgw_frontends`` to Civetweb.

Referring back to the description for installing a Ceph Object Gateway with
``ceph-deploy``, notice that the configuration file only has one setting
``rgw_frontends`` (and that's assuming you elected to change the default port).
The ``ceph-deploy`` utility generates the data directory and the keyring for
you--placing the keyring in ``/var/lib/ceph/radosgw/{rgw-intance}``. The daemon
looks in default locations, whereas you may have specified different settings
in your Ceph configuration file. Since you already have keys and a data
directory, you will want to maintain those paths in your Ceph configuration
file if you used something other than default paths.

A typical Ceph Object Gateway configuration file for an Apache-based deployment
looks something similar as the following:

On Red Hat Enterprise Linux::

 [client.radosgw.gateway-node1]
 host = {hostname}
 keyring = /etc/ceph/ceph.client.radosgw.keyring
 rgw socket path = ""
 log file = /var/log/radosgw/client.radosgw.gateway-node1.log
 rgw frontends = fastcgi socket\_port=9000 socket\_host=0.0.0.0
 rgw print continue = false

On Ubuntu::

 [client.radosgw.gateway-node]
 host = {hostname}
 keyring = /etc/ceph/ceph.client.radosgw.keyring
 rgw socket path = /var/run/ceph/ceph.radosgw.gateway.fastcgi.sock
 log file = /var/log/radosgw/client.radosgw.gateway-node1.log

To modify it for use with Civetweb, simply remove the Apache-specific settings
such as ``rgw_socket_path`` and ``rgw_print_continue``. Then, change the
``rgw_frontends`` setting to reflect Civetweb rather than the Apache FastCGI
front end and specify the port number you intend to use. For example::

 [client.radosgw.gateway-node1]
 host = {hostname}
 keyring = /etc/ceph/ceph.client.radosgw.keyring
 log file = /var/log/radosgw/client.radosgw.gateway-node1.log
 rgw_frontends = civetweb port=80

Finally, restart the Ceph Object Gateway. On Red Hat Enterprise Linux execute::

 sudo systemctl restart ceph-radosgw.service

On Ubuntu execute::

 sudo service radosgw restart id=rgw.<short-hostname>

If you used a port number that is not open, you will also need to open that
port on your firewall.

Configure Bucket Sharding
-------------------------

A Ceph Object Gateway stores bucket index data in the ``index_pool``, which
defaults to ``.rgw.buckets.index``. Sometimes users like to put many objects
(hundreds of thousands to millions of objects) in a single bucket. If you do
not use the gateway administration interface to set quotas for the maximum
number of objects per bucket, the bucket index can suffer significant
performance degradation when users place large numbers of objects into a
bucket.

In Ceph 0.94, you may shard bucket indices to help prevent performance
bottlenecks when you allow a high number of objects per bucket. The
``rgw_override_bucket_index_max_shards`` setting allows you to set a maximum
number of shards per bucket. The default value is ``0``, which means bucket
index sharding is off by default.

To turn bucket index sharding on, set ``rgw_override_bucket_index_max_shards``
to a value greater than ``0``.

For simple configurations, you may add ``rgw_override_bucket_index_max_shards``
to your Ceph configuration file. Add it under ``[global]`` to create a
system-wide value. You can also set it for each instance in your Ceph
configuration file.

Once you have changed your bucket sharding configuration in your Ceph
configuration file, restart your gateway. On Red Hat Enterprise Linux execute::

 sudo systemctl restart ceph-radosgw.service

On Ubuntu execute::

 sudo service radosgw restart id=rgw.<short-hostname>

For federated configurations, each zone may have a different ``index_pool``
setting for failover. To make the value consistent for a zonegroup's zones, you
may set ``rgw_override_bucket_index_max_shards`` in a gateway's zonegroup
configuration. For example::

  radosgw-admin zonegroup get > zonegroup.json

Open the ``zonegroup.json`` file and edit the ``bucket_index_max_shards`` setting
for each named zone. Save the ``zonegroup.json`` file and reset the zonegroup.
For example::

   radosgw-admin zonegroup set < zonegroup.json

Once you have updated your zonegroup, update and commit the period.
For example::

   radosgw-admin period update --commit

.. note:: Mapping the index pool (for each zone, if applicable) to a CRUSH
          rule of SSD-based OSDs may also help with bucket index performance.

Add Wildcard to DNS
-------------------
.. _Add Wildcard to DNS:

To use Ceph with S3-style subdomains (e.g., bucket-name.domain-name.com), you
need to add a wildcard to the DNS record of the DNS server you use with the
``ceph-radosgw`` daemon.

The address of the DNS must also be specified in the Ceph configuration file
with the ``rgw dns name = {hostname}`` setting.

For ``dnsmasq``, add the following address setting with a dot (.) prepended to
the host name::

 address=/.{hostname-or-fqdn}/{host-ip-address}

For example::

 address=/.gateway-node1/192.168.122.75


For ``bind``, add a wildcard to the DNS record. For example::

 $TTL    604800
 @       IN      SOA     gateway-node1. root.gateway-node1. (
                               2         ; Serial
                          604800         ; Refresh
                           86400         ; Retry
                         2419200         ; Expire
                          604800 )       ; Negative Cache TTL
 ;
 @       IN      NS      gateway-node1.
 @       IN      A       192.168.122.113
 *       IN      CNAME   @

Restart your DNS server and ping your server with a subdomain to ensure that
your DNS configuration works as expected::

 ping mybucket.{hostname}

For example::

 ping mybucket.gateway-node1

Add Debugging (if needed)
-------------------------

Once you finish the setup procedure, if you encounter issues with your
configuration, you can add debugging to the ``[global]`` section of your Ceph
configuration file and restart the gateway(s) to help troubleshoot any
configuration issues. For example::

 [global]
 #append the following in the global section.
 debug ms = 1
 debug rgw = 20

Using the Gateway
-----------------

To use the REST interfaces, first create an initial Ceph Object Gateway user
for the S3 interface. Then, create a subuser for the Swift interface. You then
need to verify if the created users are able to access the gateway.

Create a RADOSGW User for S3 Access
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

A ``radosgw`` user needs to be created and granted access. The command ``man
radosgw-admin`` will provide information on additional command options.

To create the user, execute the following on the ``gateway host``::

 sudo radosgw-admin user create --uid="testuser" --display-name="First User"

The output of the command will be something like the following::

 {
	 "user_id": "testuser",
	 "display_name": "First User",
	 "email": "",
	 "suspended": 0,
	 "max_buckets": 1000,
	 "subusers": [],
	 "keys": [{
		 "user": "testuser",
		 "access_key": "I0PJDPCIYZ665MW88W9R",
		 "secret_key": "dxaXZ8U90SXydYzyS5ivamEP20hkLSUViiaR+ZDA"
	 }],
	 "swift_keys": [],
	 "caps": [],
	 "op_mask": "read, write, delete",
	 "default_placement": "",
	 "placement_tags": [],
	 "bucket_quota": {
		 "enabled": false,
		 "max_size_kb": -1,
		 "max_objects": -1
	 },
	 "user_quota": {
		 "enabled": false,
		 "max_size_kb": -1,
		 "max_objects": -1
	 },
	 "temp_url_keys": []
 }

.. note:: The values of ``keys->access_key`` and ``keys->secret_key`` are
          needed for access validation.

.. important:: Check the key output. Sometimes ``radosgw-admin`` generates a
               JSON escape character ``\`` in ``access_key`` or ``secret_key``
               and some clients do not know how to handle JSON escape 
               characters. Remedies include removing the JSON escape character
               ``\``, encapsulating the string in quotes, regenerating the key 
               and ensuring that it does not have a JSON escape character or 
               specify the key and secret manually. Also, if ``radosgw-admin``
               generates a JSON escape character ``\`` and a forward slash ``/``
               together in a key, like ``\/``, only remove the JSON escape 
               character ``\``. Do not remove the forward slash ``/`` as it is 
               a valid character in the key.

Create a Swift User
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

A Swift subuser needs to be created if this kind of access is needed. Creating
a Swift user is a two step process. The first step is to create the user. The
second is to create the secret key.

Execute the following steps on the ``gateway host``:

Create the Swift user::

 sudo radosgw-admin subuser create --uid=testuser --subuser=testuser:swift --access=full

The output will be something like the following::

 {
	 "user_id": "testuser",
	 "display_name": "First User",
	 "email": "",
	 "suspended": 0,
	 "max_buckets": 1000,
	 "subusers": [{
		 "id": "testuser:swift",
		 "permissions": "full-control"
	 }],
	 "keys": [{
		 "user": "testuser:swift",
		 "access_key": "3Y1LNW4Q6X0Y53A52DET",
		 "secret_key": ""
	 }, {
		 "user": "testuser",
		 "access_key": "I0PJDPCIYZ665MW88W9R",
		 "secret_key": "dxaXZ8U90SXydYzyS5ivamEP20hkLSUViiaR+ZDA"
	 }],
	 "swift_keys": [],
	 "caps": [],
	 "op_mask": "read, write, delete",
	 "default_placement": "",
	 "placement_tags": [],
	 "bucket_quota": {
		 "enabled": false,
		 "max_size_kb": -1,
		 "max_objects": -1
	 },
	 "user_quota": {
		 "enabled": false,
		 "max_size_kb": -1,
		 "max_objects": -1
	 },
	 "temp_url_keys": []
  }

Create the secret key::

 sudo radosgw-admin key create --subuser=testuser:swift --key-type=swift --gen-secret

The output will be something like the following::

 {
	 "user_id": "testuser",
	 "display_name": "First User",
	 "email": "",
	 "suspended": 0,
	 "max_buckets": 1000,
	 "subusers": [{
		 "id": "testuser:swift",
		 "permissions": "full-control"
	 }],
	 "keys": [{
		 "user": "testuser:swift",
		 "access_key": "3Y1LNW4Q6X0Y53A52DET",
		 "secret_key": ""
	 }, {
		 "user": "testuser",
		 "access_key": "I0PJDPCIYZ665MW88W9R",
		 "secret_key": "dxaXZ8U90SXydYzyS5ivamEP20hkLSUViiaR+ZDA"
	 }],
	 "swift_keys": [{
		 "user": "testuser:swift",
		 "secret_key": "244+fz2gSqoHwR3lYtSbIyomyPHf3i7rgSJrF\/IA"
	 }],
	 "caps": [],
	 "op_mask": "read, write, delete",
	 "default_placement": "",
	 "placement_tags": [],
	 "bucket_quota": {
		 "enabled": false,
		 "max_size_kb": -1,
		 "max_objects": -1
	 },
	 "user_quota": {
		 "enabled": false,
		 "max_size_kb": -1,
		 "max_objects": -1
	 },
	 "temp_url_keys": []
 }

Access Verification
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Test S3 Access
""""""""""""""

You need to write and run a Python test script for verifying S3 access. The S3
access test script will connect to the ``radosgw``, create a new bucket and
list all buckets. The values for ``aws_access_key_id`` and
``aws_secret_access_key`` are taken from the values of ``access_key`` and
``secret_key`` returned by the ``radosgw-admin`` command.

Execute the following steps:

#. You will need to install the ``python-boto`` package::

    sudo yum install python-boto

#. Create the Python script::

    vi s3test.py

#. Add the following contents to the file::

    import boto.s3.connection

    access_key = 'I0PJDPCIYZ665MW88W9R'
    secret_key = 'dxaXZ8U90SXydYzyS5ivamEP20hkLSUViiaR+ZDA'
    conn = boto.connect_s3(
            aws_access_key_id=access_key,
            aws_secret_access_key=secret_key,
            host='{hostname}', port={port},
            is_secure=False, calling_format=boto.s3.connection.OrdinaryCallingFormat(),
           )

    bucket = conn.create_bucket('my-new-bucket')
    for bucket in conn.get_all_buckets():
        print "{name} {created}".format(
            name=bucket.name,
            created=bucket.creation_date,
        )


   Replace ``{hostname}`` with the hostname of the host where you have
   configured the gateway service i.e., the ``gateway host``. Replace ``{port}``
   with the port number you are using with Civetweb.

#. Run the script::

    python s3test.py

   The output will be something like the following::

    my-new-bucket 2015-02-16T17:09:10.000Z

Test swift access
"""""""""""""""""

Swift access can be verified via the ``swift`` command line client. The command
``man swift`` will provide more information on available command line options.

To install ``swift`` client, execute the following commands. On Red Hat
Enterprise Linux::

 sudo yum install python-setuptools
 sudo easy_install pip
 sudo pip install --upgrade setuptools
 sudo pip install --upgrade python-swiftclient

On Debian-based distributions::

 sudo apt-get install python-setuptools
 sudo easy_install pip
 sudo pip install --upgrade setuptools
 sudo pip install --upgrade python-swiftclient

To test swift access, execute the following::

 swift -V 1 -A http://{IP ADDRESS}:{port}/auth -U testuser:swift -K '{swift_secret_key}' list

Replace ``{IP ADDRESS}`` with the public IP address of the gateway server and
``{swift_secret_key}`` with its value from the output of ``radosgw-admin key
create`` command executed for the ``swift`` user. Replace {port} with the port
number you are using with Civetweb (e.g., ``7480`` is the default). If you
don't replace the port, it will default to port ``80``.

For example::

 swift -V 1 -A http://10.19.143.116:7480/auth -U testuser:swift -K '244+fz2gSqoHwR3lYtSbIyomyPHf3i7rgSJrF/IA' list

The output should be::

 my-new-bucket

.. _Preflight:  ../../start/quick-start-preflight
.. _HTTP Frontends: ../../radosgw/frontends
