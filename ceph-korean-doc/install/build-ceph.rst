 Build Ceph
============

You can get Ceph software by retrieving Ceph source code and building it yourself.
To build Ceph, you need to set up a development environment, compile Ceph, 
and then either install in user space or build packages and install the packages. 

Build Prerequisites
===================


.. tip:: Check this section to see if there are specific prerequisites for your 
   Linux/Unix distribution.

Before you can build Ceph source code, you need to install several libraries
and tools::

	./install-deps.sh

.. note:: Some distributions that support Google's memory profiler tool may use
   a different package name (e.g., ``libgoogle-perftools4``).

Build Ceph
==========

Ceph is built using cmake. To build Ceph, navigate to your cloned Ceph
repository and execute the following::

    cd ceph
    ./do_cmake.sh
    cd build
    make

.. note:: By default do_cmake.sh will build a debug version of ceph that may
   perform up to 5 times slower with certain workloads. Pass 
   '-DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=RelWithDebInfo' to do_cmake.sh if you would like to
   build a release version of the ceph executables instead.

.. topic:: Hyperthreading

	You can use ``make -j`` to execute multiple jobs depending upon your system. For 
	example, ``make -j4`` for a dual core processor may build faster.

See `Installing a Build`_ to install a build in user space.

Build Ceph Packages
===================

To build packages, you must clone the `Ceph`_ repository. You can create 
installation packages from the latest code using ``dpkg-buildpackage`` for 
Debian/Ubuntu or ``rpmbuild`` for the RPM Package Manager.

.. tip:: When building on a multi-core CPU, use the ``-j`` and the number of 
   cores * 2. For example, use ``-j4`` for a dual-core processor to accelerate 
   the build.


Advanced Package Tool (APT)
---------------------------

To create ``.deb`` packages for Debian/Ubuntu, ensure that you have cloned the 
`Ceph`_ repository, installed the `Build Prerequisites`_ and installed 
``debhelper``::

	sudo apt-get install debhelper

Once you have installed debhelper, you can build the packages::

	sudo dpkg-buildpackage

For multi-processor CPUs use the ``-j`` option to accelerate the build.


RPM Package Manager
-------------------

To create ``.rpm`` packages, ensure that you have cloned the `Ceph`_ repository,
installed the `Build Prerequisites`_ and installed ``rpm-build`` and 
``rpmdevtools``::

	yum install rpm-build rpmdevtools

Once you have installed the tools, setup an RPM compilation environment::

	rpmdev-setuptree

Fetch the source tarball for the RPM compilation environment::

	wget -P ~/rpmbuild/SOURCES/ https://download.ceph.com/tarballs/ceph-<version>.tar.bz2

Or from the EU mirror::

	wget -P ~/rpmbuild/SOURCES/ http://eu.ceph.com/tarballs/ceph-<version>.tar.bz2

Extract the specfile::

    tar --strip-components=1 -C ~/rpmbuild/SPECS/ --no-anchored -xvjf ~/rpmbuild/SOURCES/ceph-<version>.tar.bz2 "ceph.spec"

Build the RPM packages::

	rpmbuild -ba ~/rpmbuild/SPECS/ceph.spec

For multi-processor CPUs use the ``-j`` option to accelerate the build.
