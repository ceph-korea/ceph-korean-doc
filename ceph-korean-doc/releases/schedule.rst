Understanding the release cycle
-------------------------------

There is a new stable release cycle every year, targetting March 1st, starting
with the Nautilus release (14.2.0).  Each stable release series will
receive a name (e.g., 'Mimic') and a major release number (e.g., 13
for Mimic because 'M' is the 13th letter of the alphabet).

Releases are named after a species of cephalopod (usually the common
name, since the latin names are harder to remember or pronounce).

Version numbers have three components, *x.y.z*.  *x* identifies the release
cycle (e.g., 13 for Mimic).  *y* identifies the release type:

* x.0.z - development releases (for early testers and the brave at heart)
* x.1.z - release candidates (for test clusters, brave users)
* x.2.z - stable/bugfix releases (for users)

This versioning convention started with the 9.y.z Infernalis cycle.  Prior to
that, versions looked with 0.y for development releases and 0.y.z for stable
series.

Development releases (x.0.z)
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Each development release (x.0.z) freezes the master development branch
and applies `integration and upgrade tests
<https://github.com/ceph/ceph/tree/master/qa/suites/>`_ before it is released.  Once
released, there is no effort to backport fixes; developer focus is on
the next development release which is usually only a few weeks away.

* Development release every 8 to 12 weeks
* Intended for testing, not production deployments
* Full integration testing
* Upgrade testing from the last stable release(s)
* Every effort is made to allow *offline* upgrades from previous
  development releases (meaning you can stop all daemons, upgrade, and
  restart).  No attempt is made to support online rolling upgrades
  between development releases.  This facilitates deployment of
  development releases on non-production test clusters without
  repopulating them with data.

Release candidates (x.1.z)
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

There is a feature release roughly eight (8) weeks prior to the planned
initial stable release, after which focus shifts to stabilization and
bug fixes only.

* Release candidate release every 1-2 weeks
* Intended for final testing and validation of the upcoming stable release

Stable releases (x.2.z)
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Once the initial stable release is made (x.2.0), there are
semi-regular bug-fix point releases with bug fixes and (occasionally)
small feature backports.  Bug fixes are accumulated and included in
the next point release.

* Stable point release every 4 to 6 weeks
* Intended for production deployments
* Bug fix backports for two full release cycles.
* Online, rolling upgrade support and testing from the last two (2)
  stable release(s) (starting from Luminous).
* Online, rolling upgrade support and testing from prior stable point
  releases

For each stable release:

* `Integration and upgrade tests
  <https://github.com/ceph/ceph/tree/master/qa/suites/>`_ are run on a regular basis
  and `their results <http://pulpito.ceph.com/>`_ analyzed by Ceph
  developers.
* `Issues <http://tracker.ceph.com/projects/ceph/issues?query_id=27>`_
  fixed in the development branch (master) are scheduled to be backported.
* When an issue found in the stable release is `reported
  <http://tracker.ceph.com/projects/ceph/issues/new>`_, it is
  triaged by Ceph developers.
* The `stable releases and backport team <http://tracker.ceph.com/projects/ceph-releases/wiki>`_
  publishes ``point releases`` including fixes that have been backported to the stable release.

In the timeline above, the life time of a stable release series is
calculated to be approximately 24 months (i.e., two 12 month release
cycles) after the month of the first release.  For example, Mimic
(13.2.z) will reach end of life (EOL) shortly after Octopus (15.2.0) is
released.  The lifetime of a release may vary because it depends on how
quickly the stable releases are published.

The life time for Jewel and Kraken are slightly different.  Prior to
Luminous, only every other stable release was an "LTS" release.
Therefore,

* Upgrades are supported from Jewel -> Kraken -> Luminous and Jewel -> Luminous.
* Upgrades from Jewel or Kraken must upgrade to Luminous first before proceeding further (e.g., Kraken -> Luminous -> Mimic but not Kraken -> Mimic).
* Jewel will be maintained until Mimic is released in the spring of 2018.
* Kraken is no longer maintained.
