:Description: If ``true`` monitors force standby-replay to be active. Set
              under ``[mon]`` or ``[global]``.

:Type: Boolean
:Default: ``true`` 

``mds cache memory limit``

:Description: The memory limit the MDS should enforce for its cache.
              Administrators should use this instead of ``mds cache size``.
:Type:  64-bit Integer Unsigned
:Default: ``1073741824``

``mds cache reservation``

:Description: The cache reservation (memory or inodes) for the MDS cache to maintain.
              Once the MDS begins dipping into its reservation, it will recall
              client state until its cache size shrinks to restore the
              reservation.
:Type:  Float
:Default: ``0.05``

``mds cache size``

:Description: The number of inodes to cache. A value of 0 indicates an
              unlimited number. It is recommended to use
              ``mds_cache_memory_limit`` to limit the amount of memory the MDS
              cache uses.
:Type:  32-bit Integer
:Default: ``0``

              (from the top).

              a full update (instead of partial update).

:Description: The blacklist duration for failed MDSs in the OSD map. Note,
              this controls how long failed MDS daemons will stay in the
              OSDMap blacklist. It has no effect on how long something is
              blacklisted when the administrator blacklists it manually. For
