Using Hadoop with CephFS
========================

The Ceph file system can be used as a drop-in replacement for the Hadoop File
System (HDFS). This page describes the installation and configuration process
of using Ceph with Hadoop.

Dependencies
============

* CephFS Java Interface
* Hadoop CephFS Plugin

.. important:: Currently requires Hadoop 1.1.X stable series

Installation
============

There are three requirements for using CephFS with Hadoop. First, a running
Ceph installation is required. The details of setting up a Ceph cluster and
the file system are beyond the scope of this document. Please refer to the
Ceph documentation for installing Ceph.

The remaining two requirements are a Hadoop installation, and the Ceph file
system Java packages, including the Java CephFS Hadoop plugin. The high-level
steps are two add the dependencies to the Hadoop installation ``CLASSPATH``,
and configure Hadoop to use the Ceph file system.

CephFS Java Packages
--------------------

* CephFS Hadoop plugin (`hadoop-cephfs.jar <https://download.ceph.com/tarballs/hadoop-cephfs.jar>`_)

Adding these dependencies to a Hadoop installation will depend on your
particular deployment. In general the dependencies must be present on each
node in the system that will be part of the Hadoop cluster, and must be in the
``CLASSPATH`` searched for by Hadoop. Typically approaches are to place the
additional ``jar`` files into the ``hadoop/lib`` directory, or to edit the
``HADOOP_CLASSPATH`` variable in ``hadoop-env.sh``.

The native Ceph file system client must be installed on each participating
node in the Hadoop cluster.

Hadoop Configuration
====================

This section describes the Hadoop configuration options used to control Ceph.
These options are intended to be set in the Hadoop configuration file
`conf/core-site.xml`.

Support For Per-file Custom Replication
---------------------------------------

The Hadoop file system interface allows users to specify a custom replication
factor (e.g. 3 copies of each block) when creating a file. However, object
replication factors in the Ceph file system are controlled on a per-pool
basis, and by default a Ceph file system will contain only a single
pre-configured pool. Thus, in order to support per-file replication with
Hadoop over Ceph, additional storage pools with non-default replications
factors must be created, and Hadoop must be configured to choose from these
additional pools.

Additional data pools can be specified using the ``ceph.data.pools``
configuration option. The value of the option is a comma separated list of
pool names. The default Ceph pool will be used automatically if this
configuration option is omitted or the value is empty. For example, the
following configuration setting will consider the pools ``pool1``, ``pool2``, and
``pool5`` when selecting a target pool to store a file. ::

	<property>
	  <name>ceph.data.pools</name>
	  <value>pool1,pool2,pool5</value>
	</property>

Hadoop will not create pools automatically. In order to create a new pool with
a specific replication factor use the ``ceph osd pool create`` command, and then
set the ``size`` property on the pool using the ``ceph osd pool set`` command. For
more information on creating and configuring pools see the `RADOS Pool
documentation`_.

.. _RADOS Pool documentation: ../../rados/operations/pools

Once a pool has been created and configured the metadata service must be told
that the new pool may be used to store file data. A pool is be made available
for storing file system data using the ``ceph fs add_data_pool`` command.

First, create the pool. In this example we create the ``hadoop1`` pool with
replication factor 1. ::

    ceph osd pool create hadoop1 100
    ceph osd pool set hadoop1 size 1

Next, determine the pool id. This can be done by examining the output of the
``ceph osd dump`` command. For example, we can look for the newly created
``hadoop1`` pool. ::

    ceph osd dump | grep hadoop1

The output should resemble::

    pool 3 'hadoop1' rep size 1 min_size 1 crush_rule 0...

Where ``3`` is the pool id. Next we will use the pool id reference to register
the pool as a data pool for storing file system data. ::

    ceph fs add_data_pool cephfs 3

The final step is to configure Hadoop to consider this data pool when
selecting the target pool for new files. ::

	<property>
		<name>ceph.data.pools</name>
		<value>hadoop1</value>
	</property>

Pool Selection Rules
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The following rules describe how Hadoop chooses a pool given a desired
replication factor and the set of pools specified using the
``ceph.data.pools`` configuration option.

1. When no custom pools are specified the default Ceph data pool is used.
2. A custom pool with the same replication factor as the default Ceph data
   pool will override the default.
3. A pool with a replication factor that matches the desired replication will
   be chosen if it exists.
4. Otherwise, a pool with at least the desired replication factor will be
   chosen, or the maximum possible.

Debugging Pool Selection
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Hadoop will produce log file entry when it cannot determine the replication
factor of a pool (e.g. it is not configured as a data pool). The log message
will appear as follows::

    Error looking up replication of pool: <pool name>

Hadoop will also produce a log entry when it wasn't able to select an exact
match for replication. This log entry will appear as follows::

    selectDataPool path=<path> pool:repl=<name>:<value> wanted=<value>
