=====================
 Preflight Checklist
=====================

.. versionadded:: 0.60

This **Preflight Checklist** will help you prepare an admin node for use with
``ceph-deploy``,  and server nodes for use with passwordless ``ssh`` and
``sudo``.

Before you can deploy Ceph using ``ceph-deploy``, you need to ensure that you
have a few things set up first on your admin node and on nodes running Ceph
daemons.
 

Install an Operating System
===========================

Install a recent release of Debian or Ubuntu (e.g., 16.04 LTS) on
your nodes. For additional details on operating systems or to use other
operating systems other than Debian or Ubuntu, see `OS Recommendations`_.


Install an SSH Server
=====================

The ``ceph-deploy`` utility requires ``ssh``, so your server node(s) require an
SSH server. ::

	sudo apt-get install openssh-server


Create a User
=============

Create a user on nodes running Ceph daemons. 

.. tip:: We recommend a username that brute force attackers won't
   guess easily (e.g., something other than ``root``, ``ceph``, etc).

::

	ssh user@ceph-server
	sudo useradd -d /home/ceph -m ceph
	sudo passwd ceph


``ceph-deploy`` installs packages onto your nodes. This means that
the user you create requires passwordless ``sudo`` privileges. 

.. note:: We **DO NOT** recommend enabling the ``root`` password 
   for security reasons. 

To provide full privileges to the user, add the following to 
``/etc/sudoers.d/ceph``. ::

	echo "ceph ALL = (root) NOPASSWD:ALL" | sudo tee /etc/sudoers.d/ceph
	sudo chmod 0440 /etc/sudoers.d/ceph


Configure SSH
=============

Configure your admin machine with password-less SSH access to each node
running Ceph daemons (leave the passphrase empty). ::

	ssh-keygen
	Generating public/private key pair.
	Enter file in which to save the key (/ceph-client/.ssh/id_rsa):
	Enter passphrase (empty for no passphrase):
	Enter same passphrase again:
	Your identification has been saved in /ceph-client/.ssh/id_rsa.
	Your public key has been saved in /ceph-client/.ssh/id_rsa.pub.

Copy the key to each node running Ceph daemons:: 

	ssh-copy-id ceph@ceph-server

Modify your ~/.ssh/config file of your admin node so that it defaults 
to logging in as the user you created when no username is specified. ::

	Host ceph-server
		Hostname ceph-server.fqdn-or-ip-address.com
		User ceph


Install ceph-deploy
===================

To install ``ceph-deploy``, execute the following:: 

	wget -q -O- 'https://download.ceph.com/keys/release.asc' | sudo apt-key add -
	echo deb http://ceph.com/debian-dumpling/ $(lsb_release -sc) main | sudo tee /etc/apt/sources.list.d/ceph.list
	sudo apt-get update	
	sudo apt-get install ceph-deploy


Ensure Connectivity
===================

Ensure that your Admin node has connectivity to the network and to your Server
node (e.g., ensure ``iptables``, ``ufw`` or other tools that may prevent
connections, traffic forwarding, etc. to allow what you need).


Once you have completed this pre-flight checklist, you are ready to begin using
``ceph-deploy``.
