BlueStore Config Reference
==========================

Devices
=======

BlueStore manages either one, two, or (in certain cases) three storage
devices.

In the simplest case, BlueStore consumes a single (primary) storage device.
The storage device is normally used as a whole, occupying the full device that
is managed directly by BlueStore. This *primary device* is normally identified
by a ``block`` symlink in the data directory.

The data directory is a ``tmpfs`` mount which gets populated (at boot time, or
when ``ceph-volume`` activates it) with all the common OSD files that hold
information about the OSD, like: its identifier, which cluster it belongs to,
and its private keyring.

It is also possible to deploy BlueStore across two additional devices:

* A *WAL device* (identified as ``block.wal`` in the data directory) can be
  used for BlueStore's internal journal or write-ahead log. It is only useful
  to use a WAL device if the device is faster than the primary device (e.g.,
  when it is on an SSD and the primary device is an HDD).
* A *DB device* (identified as ``block.db`` in the data directory) can be used
  for storing BlueStore's internal metadata.  BlueStore (or rather, the
  embedded RocksDB) will put as much metadata as it can on the DB device to
  improve performance.  If the DB device fills up, metadata will spill back
  onto the primary device (where it would have been otherwise).  Again, it is
  only helpful to provision a DB device if it is faster than the primary
  device.

If there is only a small amount of fast storage available (e.g., less
than a gigabyte), we recommend using it as a WAL device.  If there is
more, provisioning a DB device makes more sense.  The BlueStore
journal will always be placed on the fastest device available, so
using a DB device will provide the same benefit that the WAL device
would while *also* allowing additional metadata to be stored there (if
it will fit).

A single-device BlueStore OSD can be provisioned with::

  ceph-volume lvm prepare --bluestore --data <device>

To specify a WAL device and/or DB device, ::

  ceph-volume lvm prepare --bluestore --data <device> --block.wal <wal-device> --block.db <db-device>

.. note:: --data can be a Logical Volume using the vg/lv notation. Other
          devices can be existing logical volumes or GPT partitions

Provisioning strategies
-----------------------
Although there are multiple ways to deploy a Bluestore OSD (unlike Filestore
which had 1) here are two common use cases that should help clarify the
initial deployment strategy:

.. _bluestore-single-type-device-config:

**block (data) only**
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
If all the devices are the same type, for example all are spinning drives, and
there are no fast devices to combine these, it makes sense to just deploy with
block only and not try to separate ``block.db`` or ``block.wal``. The
:ref:`ceph-volume-lvm` call for a single ``/dev/sda`` device would look like::

    ceph-volume lvm create --bluestore --data /dev/sda

If logical volumes have already been created for each device (1 LV using 100%
of the device), then the :ref:`ceph-volume-lvm` call for an lv named
``ceph-vg/block-lv`` would look like::

    ceph-volume lvm create --bluestore --data ceph-vg/block-lv

.. _bluestore-mixed-device-config:

**block and block.db**
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
If there is a mix of fast and slow devices (spinning and solid state),
it is recommended to place ``block.db`` on the faster device while ``block``
(data) lives on the slower (spinning drive). Sizing for ``block.db`` should be
as large as possible to avoid performance penalties otherwise. The
``ceph-volume`` tool is currently not able to create these automatically, so
the volume groups and logical volumes need to be created manually.

For the below example, lets assume 4 spinning drives (sda, sdb, sdc, and sdd)
and 1 solid state drive (sdx). First create the volume groups::

    $ vgcreate ceph-block-0 /dev/sda
    $ vgcreate ceph-block-1 /dev/sdb
    $ vgcreate ceph-block-2 /dev/sdc
    $ vgcreate ceph-block-3 /dev/sdd

Now create the logical volumes for ``block``::

    $ lvcreate -l 100%FREE -n block-0 ceph-block-0
    $ lvcreate -l 100%FREE -n block-1 ceph-block-1
    $ lvcreate -l 100%FREE -n block-2 ceph-block-2
    $ lvcreate -l 100%FREE -n block-3 ceph-block-3

We are creating 4 OSDs for the four slow spinning devices, so assuming a 200GB
SSD in ``/dev/sdx`` we will create 4 logical volumes, each of 50GB::

    $ vgcreate ceph-db-0 /dev/sdx
    $ lvcreate -L 50GB -n db-0 ceph-db-0
    $ lvcreate -L 50GB -n db-1 ceph-db-0
    $ lvcreate -L 50GB -n db-2 ceph-db-0
    $ lvcreate -L 50GB -n db-3 ceph-db-0

Finally, create the 4 OSDs with ``ceph-volume``::

    $ ceph-volume lvm create --bluestore --data ceph-block-0/block-0 --block.db ceph-db-0/db-0
    $ ceph-volume lvm create --bluestore --data ceph-block-1/block-1 --block.db ceph-db-0/db-1
    $ ceph-volume lvm create --bluestore --data ceph-block-2/block-2 --block.db ceph-db-0/db-2
    $ ceph-volume lvm create --bluestore --data ceph-block-3/block-3 --block.db ceph-db-0/db-3

These operations should end up creating 4 OSDs, with ``block`` on the slower
spinning drives and a 50GB logical volume for each coming from the solid state
drive.

Sizing
======
When using a :ref:`mixed spinning and solid drive setup
<bluestore-mixed-device-config>` it is important to make a large-enough
``block.db`` logical volume for Bluestore. Generally, ``block.db`` should have
*as large as possible* logical volumes.

It is recommended that the ``block.db`` size isn't smaller than 4% of
``block``. For example, if the ``block`` size is 1TB, then ``block.db``
shouldn't be less than 40GB.

If *not* using a mix of fast and slow devices, it isn't required to create
separate logical volumes for ``block.db`` (or ``block.wal``). Bluestore will
automatically manage these within the space of ``block``.


Automatic Cache Sizing
======================

Bluestore can be configured to automatically resize it's caches when tc_malloc
is configured as the memory allocator and the ``bluestore_cache_autotune``
setting is enabled.  This option is currently enabled by default.  Bluestore
will attempt to keep OSD heap memory usage under a designated target size via
the ``osd_memory_target`` configuration option.  This is a best effort
algorithm and caches will not shrink smaller than the amount specified by
``osd_memory_cache_min``.  Cache ratios will be chosen based on a hierarchy
of priorities.  If priority information is not availabe, the
``bluestore_cache_meta_ratio`` and ``bluestore_cache_kv_ratio`` options are
used as fallbacks.

``bluestore_cache_autotune``

:Description: Automatically tune the ratios assigned to different bluestore caches while respecting minimum values.
:Type: Boolean
:Required: Yes
:Default: ``True``

``osd_memory_target``

:Description: When tcmalloc is available and cache autotuning is enabled, try to keep this many bytes mapped in memory. Note: This may not exactly match the RSS memory usage of the process.  While the total amount of heap memory mapped by the process should generally stay close to this target, there is no guarantee that the kernel will actually reclaim  memory that has been unmapped.  During initial developement, it was found that some kernels result in the OSD's RSS Memory exceeding the mapped memory by up to 20%.  It is hypothesised however, that the kernel generally may be more aggressive about reclaiming unmapped memory when there is a high amount of memory pressure.  Your mileage may vary.
:Type: Unsigned Integer
:Required: Yes
:Default: ``4294967296``

``bluestore_cache_autotune_chunk_size``

:Description: The chunk size in bytes to allocate to caches when cache autotune is enabled.  When the autotuner assigns memory to different caches, it will allocate memory in chunks.  This is done to avoid evictions when there are minor fluctuations in the heap size or autotuned cache ratios.
:Type: Unsigned Integer
:Required: No
:Default: ``33554432``

``bluestore_cache_autotune_interval``

:Description: The number of seconds to wait between rebalances when cache autotune is enabled.  This setting changes how quickly the ratios of the difference caches are recomputed.  Note:  Setting the interval too small can result in high CPU usage and lower performance.
:Type: Float
:Required: No
:Default: ``5``

``osd_memory_base``

:Description: When tcmalloc and cache autotuning is enabled, estimate the minimum amount of memory in bytes the OSD will need.  This is used to help the autotuner estimate the expected aggregate memory consumption of the caches.
:Type: Unsigned Interger
:Required: No
:Default: ``805306368``

``osd_memory_expected_fragmentation``

:Description: When tcmalloc and cache autotuning is enabled, estimate the percent of memory fragmentation.  This is used to help the autotuner estimate the expected aggregate memory consumption of the caches.
:Type: Float
:Required: No
:Default: ``0.15``

``osd_memory_cache_min``

:Description: When tcmalloc and cache autotuning is enabled, set the minimum amount of memory used for caches. Note: Setting this value too low can result in significant cache thrashing.
:Type: Unsigned Integer
:Required: No
:Default: ``134217728``

``osd_memory_cache_resize_interval``

:Description: When tcmalloc and cache autotuning is enabled, wait this many seconds between resizing caches.  This setting changes the total amount of memory available for bluestore to use for caching.  Note: Setting the interval too small can result in memory allocator thrashing and lower performance.
:Type: Float
:Required: No
:Default: ``1``


Manual Cache Sizing
===================

The amount of memory consumed by each OSD for BlueStore's cache is
determined by the ``bluestore_cache_size`` configuration option.  If
that config option is not set (i.e., remains at 0), there is a
different default value that is used depending on whether an HDD or
SSD is used for the primary device (set by the
``bluestore_cache_size_ssd`` and ``bluestore_cache_size_hdd`` config
options).

BlueStore and the rest of the Ceph OSD does the best it can currently
to stick to the budgeted memory.  Note that on top of the configured
cache size, there is also memory consumed by the OSD itself, and
generally some overhead due to memory fragmentation and other
allocator overhead.

The configured cache memory budget can be used in a few different ways:

* Key/Value metadata (i.e., RocksDB's internal cache)
* BlueStore metadata
* BlueStore data (i.e., recently read or written object data)

Cache memory usage is governed by the following options:
``bluestore_cache_meta_ratio`` and ``bluestore_cache_kv_ratio``.
The fraction of the cache devoted to data
is governed by the effective bluestore cache size (depending on
``bluestore_cache_size[_ssd|_hdd]`` settings and the device class of the primary
device) as well as the meta and kv ratios.
The data fraction can be calculated by
``<effective_cache_size> * (1 - bluestore_cache_meta_ratio - bluestore_cache_kv_ratio)``

``bluestore_cache_size``

:Description: The amount of memory BlueStore will use for its cache.  If zero, ``bluestore_cache_size_hdd`` or ``bluestore_cache_size_ssd`` will be used instead.
:Type: Unsigned Integer
:Required: Yes
:Default: ``0``

``bluestore_cache_size_hdd``

:Description: The default amount of memory BlueStore will use for its cache when backed by an HDD.
:Type: Unsigned Integer
:Required: Yes
:Default: ``1 * 1024 * 1024 * 1024`` (1 GB)

``bluestore_cache_size_ssd``

:Description: The default amount of memory BlueStore will use for its cache when backed by an SSD.
:Type: Unsigned Integer
:Required: Yes
:Default: ``3 * 1024 * 1024 * 1024`` (3 GB)

``bluestore_cache_meta_ratio``

:Description: The ratio of cache devoted to metadata.
:Type: Floating point
:Required: Yes
:Default: ``.4``

``bluestore_cache_kv_ratio``

:Description: The ratio of cache devoted to key/value data (rocksdb).
:Type: Floating point
:Required: Yes
:Default: ``.4``

``bluestore_cache_kv_max``

:Description: The maximum amount of cache devoted to key/value data (rocksdb).
:Type: Unsigned Integer
:Required: Yes
:Default: ``512 * 1024*1024`` (512 MB)


Checksums
=========

BlueStore checksums all metadata and data written to disk.  Metadata
checksumming is handled by RocksDB and uses `crc32c`. Data
checksumming is done by BlueStore and can make use of `crc32c`,
`xxhash32`, or `xxhash64`.  The default is `crc32c` and should be
suitable for most purposes.

Full data checksumming does increase the amount of metadata that
BlueStore must store and manage.  When possible, e.g., when clients
hint that data is written and read sequentially, BlueStore will
checksum larger blocks, but in many cases it must store a checksum
value (usually 4 bytes) for every 4 kilobyte block of data.

It is possible to use a smaller checksum value by truncating the
checksum to two or one byte, reducing the metadata overhead.  The
trade-off is that the probability that a random error will not be
detected is higher with a smaller checksum, going from about one in
four billion with a 32-bit (4 byte) checksum to one in 65,536 for a
16-bit (2 byte) checksum or one in 256 for an 8-bit (1 byte) checksum.
The smaller checksum values can be used by selecting `crc32c_16` or
`crc32c_8` as the checksum algorithm.

The *checksum algorithm* can be set either via a per-pool
``csum_type`` property or the global config option.  For example, ::

  ceph osd pool set <pool-name> csum_type <algorithm>

``bluestore_csum_type``

:Description: The default checksum algorithm to use.
:Type: String
:Required: Yes
:Valid Settings: ``none``, ``crc32c``, ``crc32c_16``, ``crc32c_8``, ``xxhash32``, ``xxhash64``
:Default: ``crc32c``


Inline Compression
==================

BlueStore supports inline compression using `snappy`, `zlib`, or
`lz4`. Please note that the `lz4` compression plugin is not
distributed in the official release.

Whether data in BlueStore is compressed is determined by a combination
of the *compression mode* and any hints associated with a write
operation.  The modes are:

* **none**: Never compress data.
* **passive**: Do not compress data unless the write operation has a
  *compressible* hint set.
* **aggressive**: Compress data unless the write operation has an
  *incompressible* hint set.
* **force**: Try to compress data no matter what.

For more information about the *compressible* and *incompressible* IO
hints, see :c:func:`rados_set_alloc_hint`.

Note that regardless of the mode, if the size of the data chunk is not
reduced sufficiently it will not be used and the original
(uncompressed) data will be stored.  For example, if the ``bluestore
compression required ratio`` is set to ``.7`` then the compressed data
must be 70% of the size of the original (or smaller).

The *compression mode*, *compression algorithm*, *compression required
ratio*, *min blob size*, and *max blob size* can be set either via a
per-pool property or a global config option.  Pool properties can be
set with::

  ceph osd pool set <pool-name> compression_algorithm <algorithm>
  ceph osd pool set <pool-name> compression_mode <mode>
  ceph osd pool set <pool-name> compression_required_ratio <ratio>
  ceph osd pool set <pool-name> compression_min_blob_size <size>
  ceph osd pool set <pool-name> compression_max_blob_size <size>

``bluestore compression algorithm``

:Description: The default compressor to use (if any) if the per-pool property
              ``compression_algorithm`` is not set. Note that zstd is *not*
              recommended for bluestore due to high CPU overhead when
              compressing small amounts of data.
:Type: String
:Required: No
:Valid Settings: ``lz4``, ``snappy``, ``zlib``, ``zstd``
:Default: ``snappy``

``bluestore compression mode``

:Description: The default policy for using compression if the per-pool property
              ``compression_mode`` is not set. ``none`` means never use
              compression. ``passive`` means use compression when
              :c:func:`clients hint <rados_set_alloc_hint>` that data is
              compressible.  ``aggressive`` means use compression unless
              clients hint that data is not compressible.  ``force`` means use
              compression under all circumstances even if the clients hint that
              the data is not compressible.
:Type: String
:Required: No
:Valid Settings: ``none``, ``passive``, ``aggressive``, ``force``
:Default: ``none``

``bluestore compression required ratio``

:Description: The ratio of the size of the data chunk after
              compression relative to the original size must be at
              least this small in order to store the compressed
              version.

:Type: Floating point
:Required: No
:Default: .875

``bluestore compression min blob size``

:Description: Chunks smaller than this are never compressed.
              The per-pool property ``compression_min_blob_size`` overrides
              this setting.

:Type: Unsigned Integer
:Required: No
:Default: 0

``bluestore compression min blob size hdd``

:Description: Default value of ``bluestore compression min blob size``

:Description: Chunks larger than this are broken into smaller blobs sizing
              ``bluestore compression max blob size`` before being compressed.
              The per-pool property ``compression_max_blob_size`` overrides
              this setting.

SPDK Usage
==================

If you want to use SPDK driver for NVME SSD, you need to ready your system.
Please refer to `SPDK document`__ for more details.

.. __: http://www.spdk.io/doc/getting_started.html#getting_started_examples

SPDK offers a script to configure the device automatically. Users can run the
script as root::

  $ sudo src/spdk/scripts/setup.sh

Then you need to specify NVMe device's device selector here with "spdk:" prefix for
``bluestore_block_path``.

For example, users can find the device selector of an Intel PCIe SSD with::

  $ lspci -mm -n -D -d 8086:0953

The device selector always has the form of ``DDDD:BB:DD.FF`` or ``DDDD.BB.DD.FF``.

and then set::

  bluestore block path = spdk:0000:01:00.0

Where ``0000:01:00.0`` is the device selector found in the output of ``lspci``
command above.

If you want to run multiple SPDK instances per node, you must specify the
amount of dpdk memory size in MB each instance will use, to make sure each
instance uses its own dpdk memory

In most cases, we only need one device to serve as data, db, db wal purposes.
We need to make sure configurations below to make sure all IOs issued under
SPDK.::

  bluestore_block_db_path = ""
  bluestore_block_db_size = 0
  bluestore_block_wal_path = ""
  bluestore_block_wal_size = 0

Otherwise, the current implementation will setup symbol file to kernel
filesystem location and uses kernel driver to issue DB/WAL IO.
