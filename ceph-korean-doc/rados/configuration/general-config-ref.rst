 General Config Reference
==========================


``fsid``

:Description: The filesystem ID. One per cluster.
:Type: UUID
:Required: No. 
:Default: N/A. Usually generated by deployment tools.


``admin socket``

:Description: The socket for executing administrative commands on a daemon, 
              irrespective of whether Ceph Monitors have established a quorum.

:Type: String
:Required: No
:Default: ``/var/run/ceph/$cluster-$name.asok`` 


``pid file``

:Description: The file in which the mon, osd or mds will write its
              PID.  For instance, ``/var/run/$cluster/$type.$id.pid``
              will create /var/run/ceph/mon.a.pid for the ``mon`` with
              id ``a`` running in the ``ceph`` cluster. The ``pid
              file`` is removed when the daemon stops gracefully. If
              the process is not daemonized (i.e. runs with the ``-f``
              or ``-d`` option), the ``pid file`` is not created. 
:Type: String
:Required: No
:Default: No


``chdir``

:Description: The directory Ceph daemons change to once they are 
              up and running. Default ``/`` directory recommended.

:Type: String
:Required: No
:Default: ``/``


``max open files``

:Description: If set, when the :term:`Ceph Storage Cluster` starts, Ceph sets 
              the  ``max open fds`` at the OS level (i.e., the max # of file 
              descriptors). It helps prevents Ceph OSD Daemons from running out
              of file descriptors.

:Type: 64-bit Integer
:Required: No
:Default: ``0``


``fatal signal handlers``

:Description: If set, we will install signal handlers for SEGV, ABRT, BUS, ILL,
              FPE, XCPU, XFSZ, SYS signals to generate a useful log message

:Type: Boolean
:Default: ``true``
