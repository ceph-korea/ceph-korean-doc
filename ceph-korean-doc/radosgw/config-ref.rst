======================================
 Ceph Object Gateway Config Reference
======================================

The following settings may added to the Ceph configuration file (i.e., usually
``ceph.conf``) under the ``[client.radosgw.{instance-name}]`` section. The
settings may contain default values. If you do not specify each setting in the
Ceph configuration file, the default value will be set automatically.

Configuration variables set under the ``[client.radosgw.{instance-name}]``
section will not apply to rgw or radosgw-admin commands without an instance-name
specified in the command. Thus variables meant to be applied to all RGW
instances or all radosgw-admin commands can be put into the ``[global]`` or the
``[client]`` section to avoid specifying instance-name.

``rgw frontends``

:Description: Configures the HTTP frontend(s). The configuration for multiple
              frontends can be provided in a comma-delimited list. Each frontend
              configuration may include a list of options separated by spaces,
              where each option is in the form "key=value" or "key". See
              `HTTP Frontends`_ for more on supported options.

              ``radosgw-admin zone default``.
:Type: String
:Default: None


``rgw zonegroup``

:Description: The name of the zonegroup for the gateway instance. If no
              zonegroup is set, a cluster-wide default can be configured with
              the command ``radosgw-admin zonegroup default``.
:Type: String
:Default: None


``rgw realm``

:Description: The name of the realm for the gateway instance. If no realm is
              set, a cluster-wide default can be configured with the command
              ``radosgw-admin realm default``.
:Type: String
:Default: None


``rgw run sync thread``

:Description: If there are other zones in the realm to sync from, spawn threads
              to handle the sync of data and metadata.
:Type: Boolean
:Default: ``true``


``rgw data log window``

:Description: The data log entries window in seconds.
:Type: Integer
:Default: ``30``


``rgw data log changes size``

:Description: The number of in-memory entries to hold for the data changes log.
:Type: Integer
:Default: ``1000``


``rgw data log obj prefix``

:Description: The object name prefix for the data log.
:Type: String
:Default: ``data_log``


``rgw data log num shards``

:Description: The number of shards (objects) on which to keep the
              data changes log.

:Default: ``128``


``rgw md log max shards``

:Description: The maximum number of shards for the metadata log.
:Type: Integer
:Default: ``64``

.. important:: The values of ``rgw data log num shards`` and

:Default: ``false``


Swift Settings
==============

:Default: ``true``
	
	
``rgw swift token expiration``

:Description: The time in seconds for expiring a Swift token.
:Type: Integer
:Default: ``24 * 3600``


``rgw swift url``

:Description: The URL for the Ceph Object Gateway Swift API.
:Type: String
:Default: None
	

``rgw swift url prefix``

:Description: The URL prefix for the Swift API, to distinguish it from
              the S3 API endpoint. The default is ``swift``, which
              makes the Swift API available at the URL
              ``http://host:port/swift/v1`` (or
              ``http://host:port/swift/v1/AUTH_%(tenant_id)s`` if
              ``rgw swift account in url`` is enabled).

              For compatibility, setting this configuration variable
              to the empty string causes the default ``swift`` to be
              used; if you do want an empty prefix, set this option to
              ``/``.

              .. warning:: If you set this option to ``/``, you must
                           disable the S3 API by modifying ``rgw
                           enable apis`` to exclude ``s3``. It is not
                           possible to operate radosgw with ``rgw
                           swift url prefix = /`` and simultaneously
                           support both the S3 and Swift APIs. If you
                           do need to support both APIs without
                           prefixes, deploy multiple radosgw instances
                           to listen on different hosts (or ports)
                           instead, enabling some for S3 and some for
                           Swift.
:Default: ``swift``
:Example: "/swift-testing"


``rgw swift auth url``

:Description: Default URL for verifying v1 auth tokens (if not using internal 
              Swift auth).

:Type: String
:Default: None


``rgw swift auth entry``

:Description: The entry point for a Swift auth URL.
:Type: String
:Default: ``auth``


``rgw swift account in url``

:Description: Whether or not the Swift account name should be included
              in the Swift API URL.

              If set to ``false`` (the default), then the Swift API
              will listen on a URL formed like
              ``http://host:port/<rgw_swift_url_prefix>/v1``, and the
              account name (commonly a Keystone project UUID if
              radosgw is configured with `Keystone integration
              <../keystone>`_) will be inferred from request
              headers.

              If set to ``true``, the Swift API URL will be
              ``http://host:port/<rgw_swift_url_prefix>/v1/AUTH_<account_name>``
              (or
              ``http://host:port/<rgw_swift_url_prefix>/v1/AUTH_<keystone_project_id>``)
              instead, and the Keystone ``object-store`` endpoint must
              accordingly be configured to include the
              ``AUTH_%(tenant_id)s`` suffix.

              You **must** set this option to ``true`` (and update the
              Keystone service catalog) if you want radosgw to support
              publicly-readable containers and `temporary URLs
              <../swift/tempurl>`_.
:Type: Boolean
:Default: ``false``


``rgw swift versioning enabled``

:Description: Enables the Object Versioning of OpenStack Object Storage API.
              This allows clients to put the ``X-Versions-Location`` attribute
              on containers that should be versioned. The attribute specifies
              the name of container storing archived versions. It must be owned
              by the same user that the versioned container due to access
              control verification - ACLs are NOT taken into consideration.
              Those containers cannot be versioned by the S3 object versioning
              mechanism.

	      A slightly different attribute, ``X-History-Location``, which is also understood by 
              `OpenStack Swift <https://docs.openstack.org/swift/latest/api/object_versioning.html>`_
              for handling ``DELETE`` operations, is currently not supported.
:Type: Boolean
:Default: ``false``


``rgw trust forwarded https``

:Description: When a proxy in front of radosgw is used for ssl termination, radosgw
              does not know whether incoming http connections are secure. Enable
              this option to trust the ``Forwarded`` and ``X-Forwarded-Proto`` headers
              sent by the proxy when determining whether the connection is secure.
              This is required for some features, such as server side encryption.

QoS settings
------------

.. versionadded:: Nautilus

The ``civetweb`` frontend has a threading model that uses a thread per
connection and hence automatically throttled by ``rgw thread pool size``
configurable when it comes to accepting connections. The ``beast`` frontend is
not restricted by the thread pool size when it comes to accepting new
connections, so a scheduler abstraction is introduced in Nautilus release which
for supporting ways for scheduling requests in the future.

Currently the scheduler defaults to a throttler which throttles the active
connections to a configured limit. QoS based on mClock is currently in an
*experimental* phase and not recommended for production yet. Current
implementation of *dmclock_client* op queue divides RGW Ops on admin, auth
(swift auth, sts) metadata & data requests.


``rgw max concurrent requests``

:Description: Maximum number of concurrent HTTP requests that the beast frontend
              will process. Tuning this can help to limit memory usage under
              heavy load.
:Type: Integer
:Default: 1024


``rgw scheduler type``

:Description: The type of RGW Scheduler to use. Valid values are throttler,
              dmclock. Currently defaults to throttler which throttles beast
              frontend requests. dmclock is *experimental* and will need the
              experimental flag set


The options below are to tune the experimental dmclock scheduler. For some
further reading on dmclock, see :ref:`dmclock-qos`. `op_class` for the flags below is
one of admin, auth, metadata or data.

``rgw_dmclock_<op_class>_res``

:Default: 100.0

``rgw_dmclock_<op_class>_wgt``

:Description: The mclock weight for `op_class` requests
:Type: float
:Default: 1.0

``rgw_dmclock_<op_class>_lim``

:Description: The mclock limit for `op_class` requests
:Type: float
:Default: 0.0
