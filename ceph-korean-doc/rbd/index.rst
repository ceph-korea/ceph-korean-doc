 Ceph Block Device

.. index:: Ceph Block Device; introduction

A block is a sequence of bytes (for example, a 512-byte block of data).
Block-based storage interfaces are the most common way to store data with
rotating media such as hard disks, CDs, floppy disks, and even traditional
9-track tape. The ubiquity of block device interfaces makes a virtual block
device an ideal candidate to interact with a mass data storage system like Ceph.

Ceph block devices are thin-provisioned, resizable and store data striped over
multiple OSDs in a Ceph cluster.  Ceph block devices leverage
:abbr:`RADOS (Reliable Autonomic Distributed Object Store)` capabilities
such as snapshotting, replication and consistency. Ceph's
:abbr:`RADOS (Reliable Autonomic Distributed Object Store)` Block Devices (RBD)
interact with OSDs using kernel modules or the ``librbd`` library.

.. note:: Kernel modules can use Linux page caching. For ``librbd``-based
   applications, Ceph supports `RBD Caching`_.

Ceph's block devices deliver high performance with infinite scalability to
`kernel modules`_, or to :abbr:`KVMs (kernel virtual machines)` such as `QEMU`_, and
cloud-based computing systems like `OpenStack`_ and `CloudStack`_ that rely on
libvirt and QEMU to integrate with Ceph block devices. You can use the same cluster
to operate the :ref:`Ceph RADOS Gateway <object-gateway>`, the
:ref:`CephFS filesystem <ceph-filesystem>`, and Ceph block devices simultaneously.

.. important:: To use Ceph Block Devices, you must have access to a running
   Ceph cluster.
