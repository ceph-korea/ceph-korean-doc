==========================================
Configuring the iSCSI Target using Ansible
==========================================

The Ceph iSCSI gateway is the iSCSI target node and also a Ceph client
node. The Ceph iSCSI gateway can be a standalone node or be colocated on
a Ceph Object Store Disk (OSD) node. Completing the following steps will
install, and configure the Ceph iSCSI gateway for basic operation.

**Requirements:**

-  A running Ceph Luminous (12.2.x) cluster or newer

-  Red Hat Enterprise Linux/CentOS 7.5 (or newer); Linux kernel v4.16 (or newer)

-  The ``ceph-iscsi`` package installed on all the iSCSI gateway nodes

**Installing:**

#. On the Ansible installer node, which could be either the administration node
   or a dedicated deployment node, perform the following steps:

   #. As ``root``, install the ``ceph-ansible`` package:

      ::

          # yum install ceph-ansible

   #. Add an entry in ``/etc/ansible/hosts`` file for the gateway group:

      ::

          [ceph-iscsi-gw]
          ceph-igw-1
          ceph-igw-2

.. note::
  If co-locating the iSCSI gateway with an OSD node, then add the OSD node to the
  ``[ceph-iscsi-gw]`` section.

**Configuring:**

The ``ceph-ansible`` package places a file in the ``/usr/share/ceph-ansible/group_vars/``
directory called ``ceph-iscsi-gw.sample``. Create a copy of this sample file named
``ceph-iscsi-gw.yml``. Review the following Ansible variables and descriptions,
and update accordingly.

+--------------------------------------+--------------------------------------+
| Variable                             | Meaning/Purpose                      |

|                                      | calls. This means the iSCSI gateway  |
|                                      | must have an appropriate             |
|                                      | ``/etc/ceph/`` directory defined.    |

| ``gateway_iqn``                      | This is the iSCSI IQN that all the   |

|                                      | This means each client will see the  |

|                                      | the iSCSI gateway host name that     |
|                                      | will be responsible for the rbd      |

|                                      | ensure the rbd is not mapped to any  |
|                                      | client. If the RBD is unallocated,   |
|                                      | it will be removed from the iSCSI    |
|                                      | gateway and deleted from the         |
|                                      | configuration.                       |

| ``client_connections``               | This section defines the iSCSI       |
|                                      | client connection details together   |
|                                      | with the LUN (RBD image) masking.    |
|                                      | Currently only CHAP is supported as  |
|                                      | an authentication mechanism. Each    |
|                                      | connection defines an ``image_list`` |
|                                      | which is a comma separated list of   |
|                                      | the form                             |

|                                      | RBD images can be added and removed  |
|                                      | from this list, to change the client |
|                                      | masking. Note that there are no      |
|                                      | checks done to limit RBD sharing     |
|                                      | across client connections.           |
+--------------------------------------+--------------------------------------+

.. note::
  When using the ``gateway_iqn`` variable, and for Red Hat Enterprise Linux
  clients, installing the ``iscsi-initiator-utils`` package is required for
  retrieving the gateway’s IQN name. The iSCSI initiator name is located in the
  ``/etc/iscsi/initiatorname.iscsi`` file.

**Deploying:**

On the Ansible installer node, perform the following steps.

#. As ``root``, execute the Ansible playbook:

   ::

       # cd /usr/share/ceph-ansible
       # ansible-playbook ceph-iscsi-gw.yml

   .. note::
    The Ansible playbook will handle RPM dependencies, RBD creation
    and Linux IO configuration.

#. Verify the configuration from an iSCSI gateway node:

   ::

       # gwcli ls

   .. note::
    For more information on using the ``gwcli`` command to install and configure
    a Ceph iSCSI gateway, see the `Configuring the iSCSI Target using the Command Line Interface`_
    section.

   .. important::
    Attempting to use the ``targetcli`` tool to change the configuration will
    result in the following issues, such as ALUA misconfiguration and path failover
    problems. There is the potential to corrupt data, to have mismatched
    configuration across iSCSI gateways, and to have mismatched WWN information,
    which will lead to client multipath problems.

**Service Management:**

The ``ceph-iscsi`` package installs the configuration management
logic and a Systemd service called ``rbd-target-gw``. When the Systemd
service is enabled, the ``rbd-target-gw`` will start at boot time and
will restore the Linux IO state. The Ansible playbook disables the
target service during the deployment. Below are the outcomes of when
interacting with the ``rbd-target-gw`` Systemd service.

::

    # systemctl <start|stop|restart|reload> rbd-target-gw

-  ``reload``

   A reload request will force ``rbd-target-gw`` to reread the
   configuration and apply it to the current running environment. This
   is normally not required, since changes are deployed in parallel from
   Ansible to all iSCSI gateway nodes

-  ``stop``

   A stop request will close the gateway’s portal interfaces, dropping
   connections to clients and wipe the current LIO configuration from
   the kernel. This returns the iSCSI gateway to a clean state. When
   clients are disconnected, active I/O is rescheduled to the other
   iSCSI gateways by the client side multipathing layer.

**Administration:**

Within the ``/usr/share/ceph-ansible/group_vars/ceph-iscsi-gw`` file
there are a number of operational workflows that the Ansible playbook
supports.

.. warning::
  Before removing RBD images from the iSCSI gateway configuration,
  follow the standard procedures for removing a storage device from
  the operating system.

|                                      | clients. For example, the client     |
|                                      | issues an iSCSI logout, the          |

Once a change has been made, rerun the Ansible playbook to apply the
change across the iSCSI gateway nodes.

    # ansible-playbook ceph-iscsi-gw.yml

**Removing the Configuration:**

The ``ceph-ansible`` package provides an Ansible playbook to
remove the iSCSI gateway configuration and related RBD images. The
Ansible playbook is ``/usr/share/ceph-ansible/purge_gateways.yml``. When
this Ansible playbook is ran a prompted for the type of purge to
perform:

*lio* :

In this mode the LIO configuration is purged on all iSCSI gateways that
are defined. Disks that were created are left untouched within the Ceph
storage cluster.

*all* :

When ``all`` is chosen, the LIO configuration is removed together with
**all** RBD images that were defined within the iSCSI gateway
environment, other unrelated RBD images will not be removed. Ensure the
correct mode is chosen, this operation will delete data.

.. warning::
  A purge operation is destructive action against your iSCSI gateway
  environment.

.. warning::
  A purge operation will fail, if RBD images have snapshots or clones
  and are exported through the Ceph iSCSI gateway.
